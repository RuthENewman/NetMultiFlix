# Net Multi Flix - https://ruthenewman.github.io/NetMultiFlix/

Day 11 of challenge to build 30 vanilla JS projects over 30 days (streaming site for Soviet-period animation)

A vanilla JS web application with three primary files (index.html, index.js and style.css), with additional html pages 
for each of video clips on the site. The directory also includes image files (jpg and jpeg) and mp4 files for each 
of the episodes.

Each video allows for full screen viewing.

No copyright infringement intended by this app. As per my understanding, these cartoons are available in the public domain, 
and the site was created to share and promote these wonderful works of art and the design is inspired by the wonderful UI 
design of the ultimate streaming site.

Following completion of the challenge, I will look to add extra episodes of the existing cartoons to this site, as well as
any further features that are logical additions.
